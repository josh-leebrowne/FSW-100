                LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that
                the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information
                 with black highlighters.</p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px;">
                According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"
                —are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret
                 highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.

            <p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 20px;">
                CIA Director <b>Porter Gross</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>the Cold War</li>
                <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
                <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
            </ul>
